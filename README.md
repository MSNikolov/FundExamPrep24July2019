# FundExamPrep24July2019
Three problems I solved as a preparation for my C# Fundamentals exam. The Concert problem was created to test knowledge of data structures, the other two problems were solved with Regex. I maxed out the results with 300/300. The problem descriptions can be found here: https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1759/
